# Spotify Song Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves analysing a dataset from Spotify to extract insights on songs' audio features, popularity, mood, and more. 
I used Jupyter Notebook to create a function that recommends the time of day you should listen in and the mood of the song.
I also used **Power BI** to visualise the data and uncover patterns that show which songs work best in certain moods and times of the day.

## Process
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and formatted the data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Focused on features like Danceability, Energy, and Tempo to categorise songs based on mood and time of day.
3. **Visualisation**: Created Power BI visuals to show trends in song characteristics.

## Visualisations
- Scatter plots of Energy vs. Tempo
- Mood-based categorisation of songs
- Interactive drillthroughs for detailed song analysis

## Data Source
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, including song attributes such as Danceability, Energy, Key, Tempo, etc.
